This file shows the different types of element locator techniques and assertions used to identify elements on different screens such as check boxes and radio buttons. we also verified elements were selected or displayed using assert and assert not, for when it shouldn't be displayed. We can see a for loop where we identified the different check boxes that may change in order, they were grouped using path and stored in the variable checkboxes. I created a for loop to go inside and for all elements containing the same path stored in checkboxes. I used an if statement that if an element had the value "option2" then we would click it, assert it is selected then break the for loop. Next, for the radio buttons we identified them all using their common attribute the css selector and stored them in a variable buttons. Then, based off of the index we verified it selected the radio button we wanted. Next we verified a field was displayed and asserted it was, then we clicked on the hide button and did assert not to verify we get a false return for the element being displayed. This was created using Selenium Python PyCharm.
